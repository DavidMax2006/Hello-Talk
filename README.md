This is a program that acheives p2p chat function, it's very simple. This program called *Hello Talk* and **it just acheives a few functions**, hope *Linuxers* let it more functional.

## How to Start it

**Very simple**. You just **code the following commands in terminals** to start it:

```c

make
./server

So, it starts...:smile:

In the terminal that opened `client` , you can **send a message to Server**, and the terminal that opened `server` will receive the message from `client` , and you can reply, too!
